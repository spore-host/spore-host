## `spawn cleanup`

Remove the shared AWS resources spore.host created (tagged spawn:managed),
in dependency order. Running instances are NEVER removed — stop or terminate
them first. A cluster placement group that still has members is reported and
skipped, since EC2 refuses to delete one — re-run once those instances are gone.

Preview what would be removed with --dry-run; otherwise cleanup prompts for
confirmation (skip with --yes) and then deletes. By default it acts only on
resources you created; --all widens to every principal in the account.

A log of everything removed is written to ~/.spawn/cleanup-&lt;timestamp&gt;.log.
